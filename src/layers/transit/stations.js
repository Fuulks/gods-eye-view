/**
 * @module layers/transit/stations
 * @description The French passenger-station network as the Transit layer draws
 * it: point pins in a Cesium PointPrimitiveCollection plus the overlay
 * labels.
 *
 * WHY IT LIVES IN TRANSIT: the owner asked for the station network to be part
 * of the Transit row rather than a second row of its own, so the Layers panel
 * keeps one Transit row that draws the live GTFS-RT fleet AND the French rail
 * network's stations.
 *
 * The markers are POINT PINS, in the same PointPrimitiveCollection pattern the
 * Bike Share and satellite layers use. The network is national (2 792
 * stations), so ground ellipses big enough to see from orbit covered the map;
 * pins keep the network legible at every scale.

 * The pin sizes in pixels, and the ONE rule that drives them.
 *
 * THE RULE: a station the catalogue gives a public short code
 * (`libellecourt`) is a PRINCIPAL station and is drawn at 9 px; a station with
 * no short code is a LOCAL station and is drawn at 6 px. Nothing else moves
 * the size.
 *
 * WHY ONLY THAT SIGNAL: the SNCF passenger-station catalogue publishes a
 * station's position, name, short code, UIC code and rail segment - and
 * nothing else. It publishes NO passenger count, NO service frequency, NO
 * train capacity and NO ridership. A pin sized by any of those would be
 * drawing a number the data does not carry, so the short code is the only
 * thing the size may follow. The UIC code is an identifier, not a measure,
 * and the segment is a grouping, not a measure; neither may set a size.
 *
 * WHAT THE LIVE DATA LOOKS LIKE: as of 2026-10-28 all 2 792 stations in the
 * catalogue carry a three-character short code, so in practice every pin is
 * drawn at the principal size and the smaller local size is the fallback for a
 * station the catalogue does not name. The rule stays because it is the only
 * one the catalogue supports, and it starts doing visible work the moment a
 * station arrives without a code.
